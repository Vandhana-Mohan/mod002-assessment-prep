# Let's get started!!

# WARNING: This repo is a work-in-progress..
But feel free to enjoy the bugs. Report them if you experience any.
## Prep setup

### Getting started ..
The same as we have been doing all along.

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode or whichever text-editor you feel more comfortable with. Maybe even vim or emacs. ^_^

### Tests

Since I'm no expert the testing is a little bit different with this repo. If you are working on 01-map.js you should run the following:

```javascript
npm test 01-map.test.js
```

If you are working on 02-filter.js you should run:

```javascript
npm test 02-filter.test.js
```
and so on...

Solve the functions however you want, but use the functions that are needed in each test.
